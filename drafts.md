I recently graduated from [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) with an MS in Statistics in 2024. During my MS, I researched representation learning for computer vision under the supervision of [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home), resulting in an ECCV 2024 paper called ['SMILe'](https://anaymajee.me/assets/project_pages/smile).

Prior to that, I graduated from UTD with a BS in Data Science in 2023. During the final semester of my undergraduate education, I had the opportunity to conduct an independent study with [Prof. Vincent Ng](https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/).
