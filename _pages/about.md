I'm a machine learning engineer at IGS Energy where I design demand forecasting algorithms that can understand the unique behavior of a given individual.

I recently graduated from UTD with an MS in Statistics in 2024 (Thesis) and BS in Data Science in 2023. During my MS I researched representation learning under the supervision of Prof. Rishabh Iyer.
