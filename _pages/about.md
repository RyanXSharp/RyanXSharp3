I'm a machine learning engineer at [IGS Energy](https://www.utdallas.edu/) designing a demand forecasting algorithm to predict the hourly energy consumption of individual homes and businesses for years into the future.

Prior to this, I was a graduate researcher at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) working on representation learning for computer vision under the supervision of [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home). This resulted in an ECCV 2024 main-track paper called [SMILe](https://anaymajee.me/assets/project_pages/smile).

Before I discovered my passion for AI, I inspired thousands of youth and adults from around the world to improve their fitness with weightlifting. [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RyanXSharp) has attracted more than 13 million total views and 80,000 subscribers by showcasing my workout videos and documenting my bodybuilding journey.
