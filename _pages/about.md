I'm a machine learning engineer at <a href='https://www.igs.com/'>IGS Energy</a> designing a demand forecasting algorithm to predict the hourly energy consumption of individual homes and businesses.

I recently graduated from [UTD](https://www.utdallas.edu/) with an MS in Statistics in 2024. During my MS, I researched representation learning under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home'>Rishabh Iyer</a>.
